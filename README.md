# AMTH450-Assignment05-MATLAB

This repository contains solutions and simulations for Assignment 4 in the Applied Mathematics program at the University of Dhaka. The assignment covers a range of topics in mathematical modeling, including population growth models, logistic equations, ecological predator-prey models, Lotka-Volterra systems, epidemiological models, and autonomous systems.

## Contents

1. **Population Growth Model:** Explore population growth using the model equation and animate the family of curves.
2. **Logistic Equation:** Solve the logistic equation and sketch solution curves with varying initial populations.
3. **Ecological Predator-Prey Model:** Solve the nonlinear system for predator-prey dynamics and visualize the solutions.
4. **Lotka-Volterra System:** Investigate periodic solutions for the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model.
5. **Epidemiological Models:** Study SIR and SIS models for disease spread and visualize population dynamics.
6. **Autonomous Systems:** Analyze autonomous systems with vector fields, nullclines, and equilibrium points.

## Usage

You can access the Mathematics code and simulations for each problem in their respective directories. Feel free to explore and use the code as a reference for your own modeling and simulation tasks.
